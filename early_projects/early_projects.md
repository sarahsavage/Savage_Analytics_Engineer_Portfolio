A few of my early projects. There are definitely some changes I would make knowing what I know now but they were really fun and 
I think there are still some interesting insights. 

I'd love to have more time to download datasets and play with various hypotheses and techniques. 

**The Employee Stress Level Project** was my first big project for a Data Bootcamp. Calculations were done in excel. Transformations
were minimal as the data was clean to start but it was based on real survey responses from around the world on stress levels and
various life factors such as exercise, time spent on passion projects, and unused vacation days. The biggest takeaway for me was 
that the single factor with the highest correlation to elevated stress levels was unused PTO. Here is a

**The Case For Inclusion of Female Characters in Film** was my final project and an area of great interest to me as an avid film buff
and once upon a time actress. It is based on the Bechdel Test for movies. In order to pass, a film has to have 1. At least 2 named female characters, 2. Who have a conversation with each other, 3. About something other than a man. I gathered datasets from IMDB, publicly available film budgets, and a [crowdsourced website](https://bechdeltest.com/) with movie titles, whether they pass or fail the test, and what criteria they pass or fail in the list. I used some light sql mainly to clean datasets and standardize titles so that the various data could be joined. Analysis was done primarily in Python and then the final project was presented in a Tableau Story. Python notebooks are in the directory but the whole project can be found in [data.world](https://data.world/sarahsavage/bechdel-capstone-project). [Viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.savage/viz/TheFinancialCaseforInclusionofFemaleCharactersinFilm/TheFinancialCaseforInclusionofFemaleCharactersinFilm) is still viewable on Tableau Public. I'm not sure what I was thinking with the mustard yellow color scheme and it's probably too wordy but the analysis is very relevant. This is another one I'd love to revisit and see if things have improved in the last few years. 

**For the Right Reasons** is a project I did purely for fun, and because my sister-in-law is both a math nerd and a huge Bachelor/Bachelorette fan. I found some datasets online and manually filled in a bit based on Wikipedia pages. I did a bit of transformation via SQL and the majority of the analysis in Tableau. The images on the slide show are just screenshots from the internet and I did a full family presentation at Thanksgiving that year. Using the predictive analytics from this project, I did, in fact, correctly predict the winner of the next Bachelor season (Zach picked Kaity). Side note, I have never actually placed a bet on The Bachelor.[Slide Deck Here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uD8LXMrTg1u1G9vKQvsOhB6rUVa6kIrs4FAOZBbG3FE/edit?usp=sharing)
