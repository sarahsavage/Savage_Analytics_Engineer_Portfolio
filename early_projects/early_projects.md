A few of my early projects. There are definitely some changes I would make knowing what I know now but they were really fun and 
I think there are still some interesting insights. 

I'd love to have more time to download datasets and play with various hypotheses and techniques. 

#The Employee Stress Level Project# was my first big project for a Data Bootcamp. Calculations were done in excel. Transformations
were minimal as the data was clean to start but it was based on real survey responses from around the world on stress levels and
various life factors such as exercise, time spent on passion projects, and unused vacation days. The biggest takeaway for me was 
that the single factor with the highest correlation to elevated stress levels was unused PTO.
