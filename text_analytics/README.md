I've been using Python a fair amount lately for text analytics, which I find endlessly fascinating. 
Many companies have a wealth of free-text data that they are doing very little with. The original application
of this Python script was for the purpose of analyzing user survey data after they had finished a course. 
The text-based data was joined back to other qualitative metrics like course ratings, and additional course metadata.
I designed the script to be as "plug and play" as possible so that it could be used with other text-based
datasets with minimal editing. For this example, I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle comprised of YouTube
comments and ran my script on it. In this directory, you'll find the Python notebook, a quick Tableau dash
that I threw together as an example of how one might visualize the data, and the Tableau in the form of a 
Powerpoint, just in case you don't have Tableau installed.
