# Savage_Analytics_Engineer_Portfolio
My name is Savage and I'm a full stack Analytics Engineer with expertise in leaning analytics, product analytics, and user funnel data. 
I am adept at working with raw data, including semi-structured jsons, transforming them into usable models for business stakeholders to query, 
and building dynamic dashboards to enable self-serve data insights for non-technical stakeholders. 

My career path has been fairly non-traditional: I've been a Middle School English Teacher, Account Executive at an educational testing company, 
and now a Senior Analytics Engineer at 2U, an edtech company specializing in adult learning "from free to degree."

I have extensive experience with DBT, both cloud and core, Snowflake, and Tableau. I have also worked in Dataiku, Amplitude, Jupyter Notebooks. 
My primary coding language is SQL, largely Snowflake SQL but I am familiar with PostgreSQL/MySQL for traditional relational database use cases.
My Python experience is fairly specific to LLM-based text analytics but I am a quick study and adept enough to edit an existing script for a specific purpose.
I have experience with Salesforce data, LMS data, and eventing data, have used DataGrip, VSCode, and DBT Cloud IDEs, and am not afraid to wrangle messy data.

As a lifelong learner and former teacher, education is the thing I'm most passionate about and I love using data
to uncover solutions that drive the learning process, improve the learning experience, or make educators' lives easier, 
from early childhood through adult professionals. I'm an avid runner and yoga practitioner, and as such am interested in
using data to enhance the wellness space. This portfolio is a collection of various projects I've worked on both 
independently and as a part of my employment, intended to showcase my skills and journey as a data practitioner.
